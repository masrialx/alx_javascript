4. **Read the Instructions**: In each exercise file, you'll find instructions and comments that explain what you need to do. Follow the instructions to complete each exercise.

5. **Write Your Code**: Write your JavaScript code to solve the exercises. Feel free to experiment, test, and debug your code as needed.

6. **Test Your Solutions**: After writing your code, test your solutions by running them with Node.js. You can use the following command to run a JavaScript file:
