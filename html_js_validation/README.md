# HTML Form Submission with JavaScript Validation

This project consists of a basic HTML form that allows users to submit their name and email. The provided JavaScript code handles form submission and performs validation to ensure that all required fields are filled out correctly.

## Usage

1. Open the `form-submission.html` file in a web browser.

2. Fill in the "Name" and "Email" fields.

3. Click the "Submit" button.

4. The JavaScript code will prevent the form from submitting if the "Name" and "Email" fields are empty or if the email format is invalid.

5. If all validations pass, a success message will be displayed indicating that the form was submitted successfully.

## Files

- `form-submission.html`: The HTML file containing the form and error message element.

- `3-form-submission.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for handling form submission and validation.

## Form Fields

- **Name**: A text input field for the user's name.

- **Email**: A text input field for the user's email.

- **Phone**: A text input field for the user's phone number.

- **Message**: A textarea for the user to input a message.

- **Gender**: A dropdown select for the user to select their gender.

- **Birthdate**: A date input field for the user's birthdate.

- **Subscribe to Newsletter**: A checkbox to opt-in for newsletter subscription.

## Validation

- The JavaScript code checks if the "Name" and "Email" fields are filled.

- It also validates the email format using a regular expression.

- If any validation fails, it displays an error message.
