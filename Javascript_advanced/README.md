# Student Score Tracker Module

## Introduction

This module is a simple tool for tracking and managing the scores of students. It allows you to create instances for each student and update their scores. Each student has a name and a score that can be modified using the provided methods.

## How to Use

1. **Creating a Student Instance:**

   To create a new student instance, use the `createStudent` function. For example:

   ```javascript
   var harry = createStudent("Harry");
   var draco = createStudent("Draco");
   ```

2. **Setting and Getting Scores:**

   You can set and get the score for each student using the following methods:

   - `setScore(student, score)`: Sets the score for a student.
   - `getScore(student)`: Gets the current score of a student.

   Example:

   ```javascript
   setScore(harry, 85);
   var harryScore = getScore(harry); // Returns 85
   ```

3. **Updating Scores:**

   You can also update a student's score using the following methods:

   - `addPoints(student, points)`: Adds points to the student's current score.
   - `subtractPoints(student, points)`: Subtracts points from the student's current score.

   Example:

   ```javascript
   addPoints(draco, 10);
   subtractPoints(harry, 5);
   ```

4. **Resetting Scores:**

   You can reset a student's score to zero using the `resetScore` method:

   ```javascript
   resetScore(draco);
   ```

## Example

Here's an example of how to use this module:

```javascript
var harry = createStudent("Harry");
var draco = createStudent("Draco");

setScore(harry, 85);
setScore(draco, 92);

addPoints(harry, 5);
subtractPoints(draco, 8);

console.log(getScore(harry)); // Should display 90
console.log(getScore(draco)); // Should display 84

resetScore(harry);
console.log(getScore(harry)); // Should display 0
```

Feel free to use this simple module to keep track of student scores in your JavaScript projects!
