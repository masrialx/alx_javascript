# DOM Manipulation Examples

This repository contains simple HTML and JavaScript examples that demonstrate various aspects of Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation. Each HTML file corresponds to a specific task and showcases how to interact with HTML elements using JavaScript.

## 0-select-id.html

This example demonstrates the basic concept of the DOM by selecting and modifying an HTML element using its ID. It uses `document.getElementById` to select the element and updates its content.

## 1-select-class.html

This example illustrates how to use selectors to select specific HTML elements with a particular class and modify their format. It uses `document.querySelectorAll` to select elements with the "highlight" class and changes their content and style.

## 2-select-image.html

This example showcases how to select an `<img>` element by its ID and modify its attributes and styles. It updates the `src`, `alt`, and border style of the image using `document.getElementById`.

## 3-multiple-actions.html

This example demonstrates the creation, appending, and removal of elements using the DOM. It creates a new `<p>` element, appends it to a container, and adds a button to toggle its visibility.
